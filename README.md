# Causal Dynamic Network Modeling
CDN is a python-based package implementing causal dynamic network analysis for Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It aims to improve the dynamic causal modelling with optimization based method. Our optimization-based  method and algorithm compute efficiently the ODE parameters from fMRI data, instead of comparing potentially a huge  number of candidate ODE models. For a detailed introduction of dynamic causal modeling and our proposed method, See [(1)] and [(2)].
