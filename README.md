# Causal Dynamic Network Modeling
CDN is a python-based package implementing causal dynamic network analysis for Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It aims to improve the dynamic causal modelling with optimization based method. Our optimization-based  method and algorithm compute efficiently the ODE parameters from fMRI data, instead of comparing potentially a huge  number of candidate ODE models. For a detailed introduction of dynamic causal modeling and our proposed method, See [(1)] and [(2)]. 



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. This package is going to be published in pypi in the future. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
See setup.py for details of packages requirements. 
```

### Installing

Download the packages by using git clone https://github.com/xuefeicao/CDN.git

```
python setup.py install
```
### Intro to our package
After installing our package locally, try to import CDN in your python environment and learn about package's function. 
```
import CDN.CDN_analysis as CDN_analysis
help(CDN_analysis.CDN_multi_sub)
```


### Examples
```
The examples subfolder includes a basic analysis of CDN analysis.
```

## Running the tests

Test is going to be added in the future. The package is only tested on python 2.7 enviroment right now. A more compatible version will be published soon.
