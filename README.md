# Causal Dynamic Network Modeling
CDN is a python-based package implementing causal dynamic network analysis for Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It aims to improve the dynamic causal modelling with optimization based method. Our optimization-based  method and algorithm compute efficiently the ODE parameters from fMRI data, instead of comparing potentially a huge  number of candidate ODE models. For a detailed introduction of dynamic causal modeling, see [(1)].



## Getting Started
This package supports both python 2.7 and python 3.6.
Examples provided in the repo has been tested in mac os and linux environment. 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. This package is going to be published in pypi in the future.
